# Intelligent Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance for Autonomous Systems
________________________________________

The rapid advancement of autonomous systems, including ground and aerial robots, has led to their increased deployment in dynamic and unpredictable environments such as urban areas, warehouses, and disaster-stricken zones. These systems must navigate safely and efficiently while avoiding both static and dynamic obstacles. However, traditional navigation algorithms often struggle with the complexities of real-world environments, particularly in the presence of environmental uncertainties, moving objects, and multi-agent interactions.
